Distributed Database README
1. Configuration

Each node has its own config file in resources/config/:
config1.php, config2.php, config3.php â†’ contain DB connection info for each node.

localConfig.php â†’ tells the system which node this machine is.
It sets:

$localSignature = "1";     // which node am I?
$localConfig = [ ... ];    // connection settings for my local DB taken from config1-3 files

This way, the same code runs everywhere, but each machine knows which node it is.

2. Queue Table

On every nodeâ€™s local database, there is a replication table.
This table is responsible for inserting the values into local and remote ntovar table.
The queue ensures retries if a node was offline.

3. Insert Flow

When a user adds an item:
The item is inserted into the local queue table immediately.
Three replication tasks are created in replication_queue (one per node).

4. Processing the Queue

The script pages/process-queue.php handles replication:

Connects to the local DB.

Fetches all entries from replication table.
For each entry:
Finds the correct target node config, tries to connect and insert the record into ntovar.

On success â†’ removes the queue entry.
On failure â†’ leaves it as failed, retries later.

5. Running the Processor

The processor runs periodically as script on the homepage (subject to change) every second.

ðŸš€ Example Workflow

User on Node1 inserts a product.

Product is saved into Node1â€™s local replication table as 3 entries, one for each node.
Replication tasks are created in Node1â€™s replication_queue for node1, node2 and node3.
process-queue.php runs:
Tries to push data to NodeX â†’ NodeX online â†’ success, task removed.
Tries to push data to NodeX â†’ NodeX offline â†’ task marked as failed.

Later, NodeX comes online.
Next processor run â†’ retries failed entry â†’ success â†’ task removed.
